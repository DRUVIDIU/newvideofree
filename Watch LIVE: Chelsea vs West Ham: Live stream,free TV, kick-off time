Graham Potter brings his new West Ham United project to a familiar scene when the Irons visit his former club Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Monday.

The 14th-place Irons have 27 points, now 11 points above the drop zone ahead of Week 24 and this London derby.

WATCH â€“ Chelsea v West Ham

Potterâ€™s 31-game stint at Chelsea was a roller coaster, with the Blues winning 12 times and drawing eight for a 38.7% winning percentage.

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has already managed more games for the Blues than Potter did in the 2022-23 season, and Chelsea is 20-7-7 in those games.
