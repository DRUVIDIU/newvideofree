Graham Potter takes West Ham to his old club Chelsea in the Premier League on his first return to Stamford Bridge since being sacked as Blues manager on Monday night.

The former Brighton chief was appointed Hammers boss in early January following the departure of Julen Lopetegui and Potter has made an assertive start to his tenure, taking four points from his opening three matches.

Chelsea will be looking to move back into the Premier League's top four after slipping out of a UEFA Champions League qualification berth following a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City.
