LONDON -- A good ol' London derby is on tap for the lone English Premier League match on Monday, as West Ham heads across town for a clash with Chelsea.

After a couple of abysmal seasons, Chelsea is slowly returning back to form. While maybe not quite the powerhouse the Blues have historically been, the team is putting together a respectable effort to at least challenge for a spot in European competition. Despite losing 3-1 to Manchester City last Saturday, Chelsea is hanging around the top six in the table, thanks to picking up points in three consecutive matches, including a 3-1 win over last time out at Stamford Bridge against Wolverhampton.


Chelsea is tied for sixth with Bournemouth but only four points back of third place.

West Ham is in a strange spot. They sit in the bottom half of the league, but are not quite bad enough to be in the relegation conversation. After drawing with Aston Villa eight days ago, the Hammers have only picked up points in two of their previous five matches. That places them tied for 13th in the table, but the club is still 11 points clear of the bottom three.
