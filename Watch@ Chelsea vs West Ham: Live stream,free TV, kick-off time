Graham Potter is back at Stamford Bridge on Monday evening as Chelsea host rivals West Ham United in the Premier League.

Potter lasted less than seven months in charge of the West London club before getting his marching orders in April 2023 and waited until earlier this month to make his return to management across the capital.

There have been signs that the tide is turning at West Ham under the English coach, who has picked up four points from his first three games to climb to 14th and ease relegation fears, and he would surely love nothing more than to deliver a derby win against his former employers.

It looks like a good time for Potter to make his return to Stamford Bridge as Chelsea have won just one of their last seven Premier League games. They failed to capitalise on an early lead and first-half chances in a 3-1 defeat to Man City last weekend, which has seen them drop out of the top four into sixth.

Blues boss Enzo Maresca has insisted that his side are trending in the right direction despite recent results but they risk losing further ground in the race for the Champions League spots if they cannot get back to winning ways against the Hammers.
